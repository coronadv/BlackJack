## Description:
This is a typical BlackJack game in the theme of Jack Black. More specifically from the movie "Nacho Libre". It's you, "Ignacio" versus the great "Ramses". He is the best!

## Technologies:
The technologies used for this game were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 


## Getting Started:
This is the link to play the game [blAck jAck blAck](https://rayplaza.github.io/BlackJack/)


## Next Steps:
Currently the game has the basics of traditional BlackJack. I intend to include a betting system which would have the currency be Mexican corn or Elote. I would also like to see audio clips from the movie be incorporated in the win loss outcomes, along with an animated Nacho head.
