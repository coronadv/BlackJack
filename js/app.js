// sum function to calculate win loss or draw. (nacho libre audio quote plays depending on status)





// ---------------------------------User Actions--------------------------------------------

// User clicks on the "deal" button and a card is randomly drawn from the cards array.

// First 2 cards will "randomly" be drawn from the "cards" array and placed in the  "playerHand" array and add
// the sum of the "playerHand" array to the "playerScore" variable. Run sum function to see if player wins, loses or
// draws with dealer.
// (display both cards showing on the screen.)

// Second another 2 cards will be "randomly" drawn from the "cards" array and placed in the "dealerHand" array and
// add the sum of the "dealerHand" array to a hidden "dealerScore" variable. How will the dealer know when to hit or stay???
// (display Front of card shown on one and back of card of the other.)




// when "Hit" is clicked function starts to randomly take a card from the "cards" array and place in the "playerHand"
// array. (display facing front) if the sum of the array is more then 21 then player loses, if it is less then 21 
// then player can continue to hit or stand. 



// when "stand" is clicked no action is taken and dealerHand runs.


// Deal button resets the game at any point.
